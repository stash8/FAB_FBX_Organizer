<b> This Python script goes through the folders that FAB creates when you download a Quixel asset with multiple subfolders and combines all the FBXs into one folder. It doesn't move the textures only the FBX files. 
It should make it easier to drag and drop one group of FBX files into your program of choice. </b>


<header><h1>How to use this code</h1></header>

<body>
<p><b>Save the code:</b> Save the code as a Python file (e.g., FAB_FBX_Organizer.py).

 <b>Windows:</b> Tkinter is usually included with the standard Python installer. If you had problems before, try reinstalling Python.

 <b>macOS:</b> Tkinter might be installed with Python, but sometimes needs to be installed separately. You can try:

 An easy way to relink textures is to use Blender's built-in node wrangler (ctrl shift T), which auto-attaches the materials. You still have to do this for each model, but itâ€™s better than manually doing it.

Import files into Unity<br>
Save the file as a .blend <br>
File > External Data > Pack Resources<br>
File > External Data > Unpack Resources and choose the option to create new if needed<br>
This puts the texture file with the .blend file<br>
Import the .blend file into Unity and all material should be attached. <br>
